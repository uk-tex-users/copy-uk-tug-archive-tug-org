										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 2019 UK-TUG Annual General Meeting (AGM) will be held on Saturday 16th November at 14:00. The meeting will take place in the Fletcher Room, Trinity College, Oxford, OX1 3BH. We hope that as members as possible will be able to attend the AGM.</p>
<p>Notice is hereby given for the following.</p>
<p><em>1. Election of Chair</em></p>
<p>There were no nominations in 2018 for the position of Chair, which is therefore vacant. Anyone who wishes to stand should ask a member to nominate them for the post: in case of difficulty, please <a href="http://uk-tug-archive.tug.org/category/general/feed/uktug-committee@tug.org">approach the committee</a>. The term of Chair runs for two years from the AGM.</p>
<p>Nominations should be <a href="http://uk-tug-archive.tug.org/category/general/feed/joseph.wright@morningstar2.co.uk">sent to the Secretary</a>, by 23:59 on 1st November. The candidate should also confirm that they are happy to stand, and may be send a statement for circulation to members in support of their candidature.</p>
<p>If there is a contested election then there will be an electronic ballot. Details of the candidates and supporting statements will be circulated on Sunday 3rd November and voting will close at 23:59 on Friday 15th November.</p>
<p><em>2. Elections for the committee</em></p>
<p>The term of all committee members (with the exception of the Chair) expires at the end of the AGM. Anyone who wishes to stand should contact the Secretary at any time before the AGM. Nominations should be submitted by the candidate and supported by a second member.</p>
<p>Most of the business of the committee is carried out electronically, so a remote location should be no barrier. UK-TUG will pay reasonable travel expenses for attending committee meetings.</p>
<p>There will be a committee meeting after the AGM, likely at around 16:30.</p>
<p><em>3. Motions for the AGM</em></p>
<p>Any member may submit a motion to the AGM. Motions should be sent to the Secretary at the e-mail address above, and should be received by 23:59 on Friday 1st November. Motions and supporting documentation will be circulated on Sunday 3rd November.</p>
<p>Members not able to attend the AGM will be able to propose and vote on motions remotely. Details will be given with the motions when circulated.</p>

The first step of this process has been to add the <a href="https://github.com/uktug/uk-tex-faq">current sources to GitHub</a> within the official <a href="https://github.com/uktug/">UK-TUG GitHub account</a>. We will be assembling a small team of editors who will have direct access to the official master version of the FAQ, which will be used to update the live website and PDF version on CTAN. Anyone familiar with <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> is welcome to suggest changes using a pull request (if that makes sense you are familiar with GitHub!), or  you can <a href="https://github.com/uktug/uk-tex-faq/issues">log an issue</a> for the core team to look at. If you want to join the core team of editors, please <a href="mailto:uktug-committee@uk-tug-archive.tug.org">contact us</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For many years, one of the core servers for the <a href="http://www.cta">CTAN</a> network has been located in Cambridge and at least formally been the &#8216;UK node&#8217;: <a href="http://www.tex.ac.uk">tex.ac.uk</a>. Over recent years, the need for multiple core nodes on the network has diminished. At the same time, Robin Fairbairns, who ran the node at Cambridge, has retired leaving the status of the server itself (inside Cambridge University Computing Lab) somewhat up in the air.</p>
<p>As well as the CTAN node, <a href="http://www.tex.ac.uk">tex.ac.uk</a> has hosted the English TeX FAQ for many years, again at least formally the &#8216;UK-TUG FAQ&#8217;. Those questions and answers are extremely useful and more importantly linked to by a lot of <em>people</em>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve now made arrangements to move tex.ac.uk to a new machine and moved the FAQ across, keeping (hopefully) all of the links working. At the same time the CTAN node has been retired: <a href="http://www.dante.de">DANTE</a> are happy to run a single core node and co-ordinate the work needed for that system. UK-TUG thank Robin for his efforts over many years on CTAN and the FAQ, DANTE for taking on the key role in supporting CTAN, and our hosting partner for the new <a href="http://www.tex.ac.uk">tex.ac.uk</a> server, <a href="http://texblog.net/">Stefan Kottwitz</a>. UK-TUG will be co-ordinating work to continue maintaining and improving the FAQ and we expect to announce more details in the near future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 2014 UK-TUG AGM will be held on Saturday 29th November at 14:00. The meeting will take place as part of the UK-TUG Speaker meeting at Trinity College, Oxford, OX1 3BH. We hope that as members as possible will be able to attend the AGM and the Speaker meeting.</p>
<p>Notice is hereby given for the following.</p>
<h2>Election for Chair</h2>
<p>The two-year term of office of the Chair, Simon Dales, finishes at the end of the AGM. Anyone who wishes to stand should ask a member to nominate them for the post: in case of difficulty, please approach the committee.</p>
<p>Nominations should be sent to the Secretary by 23:59 on the 14th of November. The candidate should also confirm that they are happy to stand, and may be send a statement for circulation to members in support of their candidature.</p>
<p>If there is a contested election then there will be an electronic ballot. Details of the candidates and supporting statements will be circulated on Sunday 16th November and voting will close at 23:59 on Thursday 27th November.</p>
<h2>Elections for the committee</h2>
<p>The term of all committee members expires at the end of the AGM (with the exception of the Chair, as detailed above). Anyone who wishes to stand should contact the Secretary at any time before the AGM. Most of the business of the committee is carried out electronically, so a remote location should be no barrier. The mechanism for nominations is similar to that for Chair, with a nomination from a member along with confirmation from the candidate, although there is no need to submit any kind of statement.</p>
<h2>Motions for the AGM</h2>
<p>Any member may submit a motion to the AGM. Motions should be sent to the Secretary, and should be received by 23:59 on Friday 14th November. Motions and supporting documentation will be<br />
circulated on Sunday 16th November.</p>
<p>Voting on motions will be possible by proxy for members not able to attend the AGM. Full details will be given with the motions when circulated.</p>
<p>We look forward to hearing from you!</p>

College, Oxford. The committee hope that as members as possible will be able to attend the AGM and the Speaker meeting.</p>
<h2>Elections for the committee</h2>
<p>The term of all committee members with the exception of the Chair expires at the end of the AGM. Anyone who wishes to stand should <a  ref="mailto:secretary@uk-tug-archive.tug.org">contact the Secretary</a> at any time before the AGM. Most of the business of the committee is carried out electronically, so a remote location should be no barrier.</p>
<p>Nominations require support of a member of UK-TUG in other than the candidate themselves. This has to be received by the Secretary prior to<br />
the formal start of the AGM. In case of difficulty in finding a member to support nomination, please <a href="maiilto:committee@uk-tug-archive.tug.org">contact the committee</a>.</p>
<p>Note that the UK-TUG Chair is elected for a two year period, and our current Chair (Simon Dales) is half-way through his term. He therefore continues as Chair for a second year with no election required.</p>
<h2>Motions for the AGM</h2>
<p>Any member may submit a motion to the AGM. Motions should be sent to the <a href="mailto:secretary@uk-tug-archive.tug.org">Secretary</a>, and should be received by 23:59<br />
on Friday 25th October. Motions and supporting documentation will be circulated on Sunday 27th October. Voting on motions will be possible by proxy for members not able to attend the AGM. Full details will be given with the motions when circulated.</p>
