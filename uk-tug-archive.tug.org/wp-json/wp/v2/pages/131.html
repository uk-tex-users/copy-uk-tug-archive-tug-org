The course covers structuring a document, typesetting mathematics, creating tables, including graphics, creating a bibliography directly and by using BibTeX, using the baththesis style file to typeset a thesis and creating presentations using the seminar and beamer packages.  The course is not meant to be an exhaustive guide to these areas but does equip the students with the basic knowledge required to delve deeper into these areas if their work requires.  The course consists of eight workshops (one per week) and runs in semester one, usually from mid October until mid December.
