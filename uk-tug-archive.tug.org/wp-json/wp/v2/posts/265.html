We, the Program Committee, think otherwise; please help us to prove our point!  Although we do not restrict what your presentations should be about, we would be more than happy if your contribution will be user-centric and oriented towards the future of TeX with special emphasis on the needs, hopes and dangers.<\/p>\n<p>Proposals (abstracts) should be e-mailed to the Program Committee, which listens at the address of papers-2009 at gust dot org dot pl. Bogus\u0142aw Jackowski is the appointed chairman. Also, please note the \u201cCall for TeX Pearls\u201d below.<\/p>\n<p>Especially welcome are proposals for TeX-related tutorials or introductions. If you have suggestions for tutorials or workshops by others than yourself or about specific topics, please let us know.<\/p>\n<p>The deadline for abstracts and other proposals is the March 8th.  The deadline for final papers will soon be published at the conference web site:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"moz-txt-link-freetext\" href="http://uk-tug-archive.tug.org/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/\&quot;http:\/\/www.gust.org.pl\/BachoTeX\/2009\&quot;">http:\/\/www.gust.org.pl\/BachoTeX\/2009<\/a><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Recovery from stress<\/h2>\n<p>Exhausted TeXies will get a chance to recover their intellectual powers during nightly musical sessions, usually at a bonfire.
