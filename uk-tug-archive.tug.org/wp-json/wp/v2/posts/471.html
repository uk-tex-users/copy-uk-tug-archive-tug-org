As usual, it will be held at the traditional TeXies&#8217; and GUST meeting place, Bachotek near Brodnica, in the north-east of Poland, from April 30 until May 4, 2010, inclusive. This time we are especially trying to get-together typographers with programmers and designers of typography systems:<\/p>\n<h2>Typographers and programmers: mutual inspirations<\/h2>\n<p>Typography, the art of composing signs and graphics into pages and designing signs and graphics is nowadays inadvertently linked with using software. Programmers design and create systems which serve as tools for typographic projects.<\/p>\n<p>During this conference we want to get together two groups of people: programmers and designers of typographic systems with typographers and other users of such systems. Share your experiences. Tell others how you are doing it. Let&#8217;s together look into what programmers can offer to those who create works containing letters and other signs and how programmers can profit from the knowledge and experience of the users of such systems, designers, typographers or creators of web pages.<\/p>\n<p>The members of GUST, organizers of the conference, are especially sensitive to typesetting precision, solicitude and dependability, both in creating the tools and using them. We&#8217;d like the typographic and programming elegance and solicitude to be reflected in the conference presentations.<\/p>\n<p>Especially invited are presentations on:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>typographic projects ranging from business cards designs through web pages up to multi-volume books; we are interested is problems encountered, technologies employed, drawbacks of available software, unfulfilled dreams, successes or barriers and obstacles.<\/li>\n<li>designing and creating programs and programming systems aimed and typographic goals: both batch and interactive typesetting systems, client-server realizations, especially such for web sites.<\/li>\n<li>use of typography where programmability is vital: database extracts or combining multimedia and typography.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Of course we will gladly accept presentations relating the above with the TeX typesetting system but that is not a requirement for acceptance.<\/p>\n<p>Let this meeting of typographers and programmers creating helper systems for typography become a step towards beautiful results!<\/p>\n<h3>Submissions, deadlines and addresses<\/h3>\n<p>Proposals (abstracts) should be e-mailed to the Program Committee, which listens at the address of prog-2010 at gust dot org dot pl.
