However, it is useful to have some idea about the interests of those attending, as this enables us to prepare for at least some of the potential questions. A brief outline of your background is therefore encouraged along with your booking. It is also useful to know what operating system you usually use, as this is useful when preparing instructions on how to set up LaTeX for your own systems.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The UK TeX Users&#8217; Group (UK-TUG) periodically runs training courses in using LaTeX.
