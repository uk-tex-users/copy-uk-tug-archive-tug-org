We had a mix of talks and discussion as well of course the AGM. The talks were recorded: see the links below or look at <a href="http://uk-tug-archive.tug.org/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/\&quot;https:\/\/vimeo.com\/uktug\&quot;">the UK-TUG Vimeo page<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Morning Session<\/h2>\n<p>We kicked off this year with two videos from our Brazilian connection, Paulo Cereda. Paulo first talked about using <a href="http://uk-tug-archive.tug.org/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/\&quot;http:\/\/vimeo.com\/241331501\&quot;">code snippets in vim<\/a>, making the business of writing LaTeX documents more efficient. He then moved on to look at using TeX &#8216;in the wild&#8217;, in particular <a href="http://uk-tug-archive.tug.org/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/\&quot;http:\/\/vimeo.com\/241332536\&quot;">making bingo cards using TeX<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Paulo is on the committee for <a href="http://uk-tug-archive.tug.org/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/\&quot;https:\/\/tug.org\/tug2018\/\&quot;">TUG 2018<\/a>, so we took the opportunity to talk with him about planning for next year. Paulo told us that Lua will be a key topic: many TeX users will know that Lua has it&#8217;s origins in Brazil. The organisers of TUG 2018 also want to ensure that tutorials and other student-friendly aspects are central.<\/p>\n<p>The morning continued with Joseph Wright speaking about two LaTeX3-related topics. First, Joseph talked about recent work by the <a href="http://uk-tug-archive.tug.org/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/\&quot;https:\/\/www.latex-project.org\/\&quot;">LaTeX team<\/a> on making <a href="http://uk-tug-archive.tug.org/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/\&quot;http:\/\/vimeo.com\/241338025\&quot;">regexes available in <code>expl3<\/code><\/a>. These offer a powerful approach to pattern matching, and should give cleaner code (at least when used correctly!). He then looked briefly at ongoing work to <a href="http://uk-tug-archive.tug.org/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/\&quot;https:\/\/vimeo.com\/241339985\&quot;">port existing LaTeX2e graphics support to <code>expl3<\/code><\/a>, and how there are still a few unresolved areas to consider.<\/p>\n<p>The final talk of the morning came from Jonathan Fine. Jonathan looked at what useful information a keen student would <a href="http://uk-tug-archive.tug.org/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/\&quot;https:\/\/vimeo.com\/241342209\&quot;">find if told to &#8216;use LaTeX for your maths work&#8217;<\/a>. This led him to some expected and some less expected websites!<\/p>\n<h2>Afternoon session<\/h2>\n<p>We decamped for food to a local restaurant, where conversation ranged over TeX topics and well beyond. Returning to the venue, the formal business of the day was completed: members will receive a separate communication concerning the AGM.<\/p>\n<p>Our final talk came from David Carlisle of the <a href="http://uk-tug-archive.tug.org/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/\&quot;https:\/\/www.latex-project.org\/\&quot;">LaTeX team<\/a>. David talked about how the team are seeking to update aspects of the kernel to work with user expectations, largely about filenames: <a href="http://uk-tug-archive.tug.org/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/\&quot;https:\/\/vimeo.com\/241345469\&quot;">dots, spaces and UTF-8 support<\/a>. David also highlighted an updated math mode guide coming from the AMS.<\/p>\n<p><a
