The  meeting will be held as part of the <a href="http://uk-tug-archive.tug.org/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/\&quot;http:\/\/unconference2010.flossuk.org\/\&quot;">FLOSS Unconference<\/a> at the Birmingham and Midland  Institute, Margaret Street, Birmingham, B3 3BS, within easy walking  distance of New Street and Snow Hill stations. We hope that as members  as possible will be able to attend the AGM, and also perhaps attend  other sessions at the Unconference, or even visit the nearby exhibition  of the spectacular Anglo-Saxon Staffordshire hoard of gold and silver  jewellery.<\/p>\n<h2>Election for Chair<\/h2>\n<p>The two-year term of office of the Chair comes to an end at the AGM, and  Jonathan Fine has indicated that he does not wish to stand again. Anyone  who wishes to stand should ask a member to nominate them for the post  (in case of difficulty, ask any current member of the Committee apart  from the Returning Officer).<\/p>\n<p>Email nominations should be sent to the Returning Officer at  <a href="http://uk-tug-archive.tug.org/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/\&quot;mailto:treasurer@uk-tug-archive.tug.org\&quot;">treasurer@uk-tug-archive.tug.org<\/a>, from the email address registered in the UK-TUG  database; the candidate should also send an email agreeing to be  nominated, again from the email address in our database.  The closing  date for nominations is Monday 26th September. Candidates are asked to  include a statement (at most 1,000 words) and, if they wish, their email  address and URL. Statements received will be published on the UK TUG  website, on pages with commenting disabled.  Nominations can also be made by post: UK-TUG members should have received details of this process.<\/p>\n<p>If there is a contested election then there will be a postal ballot.  Ballot papers will be sent out on Monday 4th October, and should be  returned to the Returning Officer by midnight on Thursday 14th October.<\/p>\n<h2>Elections for the committee<\/h2>\n<p>We have at present five elected committee members (plus the Chair  ex-officio), and at least one has indicated that he will not stand for  re-election. It would be good to have some new Committee members; most  of our business is conducted electronically, so a remote location would  be no barrier. Anyone who wishes to stand should contact the Secretary,  Joseph Wright, any time before the AGM. The mechanism for nominations is  similar to that for chair (by email to <a href="http://uk-tug-archive.tug.org/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/\&quot;mailto:secretary@uk-tug-archive.tug.org\&quot;">secretary@uk-tug-archive.tug.org<\/a>, with a  member making the nomination and confirmation from the candidate)  although there is no need to submit any kind of statement. Again, members will have had details of how to nominate by post.<\/p>\n<h2>Motions for the AGM<\/h2>\n<p>Any member may submit a motion to the AGM. Motions should be sent to the  Secretary either by post or by email, at the address above, and should  be received by midnight on Friday 1st October.<\/p>\n<h2>Accounts, Treasurer&#8217;s Report and Secretary&#8217;s Report for 2009-10<\/h2>\n<p>The <a href="http://uk-tug-archive.tug.org/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/\&quot;http:\/\/uk-tug-archive.tug.org\/wp-installed-content\/uploads\/2010\/09\/accounts09-10.pdf\&quot;">uninspected accounts<\/a> are available for reading now; the formal inspected  accounts will be available at the AGM.The <a href="http://uk-tug-archive.tug.org/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/\&quot;http:\/\/uk-tug-archive.tug.org\/wp-installed-content\/uploads\/2010\/09\/treasurer_report09-10.pdf\&quot;">Treasurer&#8217;s<\/a> and <a href="http://uk-tug-archive.tug.org/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/\&quot;http:\/\/uk-tug-archive.tug.org\/wp-installed-content\/uploads\/2010\/09\/secretary-2010.pdf\&quot;">Secretary&#8217;s<\/a> reports are also available now.<\/p>\n<h2>Speaker Meeting<\/h2>\n<p>The AGM will form part of a Speaker Meeting: full details on this will follow shortly.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The 2010 UK-TUG AGM will be held on Saturday 16th October, at 2pm.
