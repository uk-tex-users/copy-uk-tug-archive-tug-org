A suggestion for this year is a workshop-like session on (relatively) recent developments in the TeX world such as XeTeX and LuaTeX, and perhaps also in the LaTeX world (packages such as <code>biblatex<\/code>). Depending on member feedback, this or indeed some other discussion element may be included in the programme.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The annual UK-TUG Speaker Meeting and AGM will take place on Saturday, 9th November at Trinity College, Oxford, OX1 3BH.
