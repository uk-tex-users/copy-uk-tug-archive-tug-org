										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 2019 UK-TUG Annual General Meeting (AGM) will be held on Saturday 16th November at 14:00. The meeting will take place in the Fletcher Room, Trinity College, Oxford, OX1 3BH. We hope that as members as possible will be able to attend the AGM.</p>
<p>Notice is hereby given for the following.</p>
<p><em>1. Election of Chair</em></p>
<p>There were no nominations in 2018 for the position of Chair, which is therefore vacant. Anyone who wishes to stand should ask a member to nominate them for the post: in case of difficulty, please <a href="http://uk-tug-archive.tug.org/author/jonathan-fine/feed/uktug-committee@tug.org">approach the committee</a>. The term of Chair runs for two years from the AGM.</p>
<p>Nominations should be <a href="http://uk-tug-archive.tug.org/author/jonathan-fine/feed/joseph.wright@morningstar2.co.uk">sent to the Secretary</a>, by 23:59 on 1st November. The candidate should also confirm that they are happy to stand, and may be send a statement for circulation to members in support of their candidature.</p>
<p>If there is a contested election then there will be an electronic ballot. Details of the candidates and supporting statements will be circulated on Sunday 3rd November and voting will close at 23:59 on Friday 15th November.</p>
<p><em>2. Elections for the committee</em></p>
<p>The term of all committee members (with the exception of the Chair) expires at the end of the AGM. Anyone who wishes to stand should contact the Secretary at any time before the AGM. Nominations should be submitted by the candidate and supported by a second member.</p>
<p>Most of the business of the committee is carried out electronically, so a remote location should be no barrier. UK-TUG will pay reasonable travel expenses for attending committee meetings.</p>
<p>There will be a committee meeting after the AGM, likely at around 16:30.</p>
<p><em>3. Motions for the AGM</em></p>
<p>Any member may submit a motion to the AGM. Motions should be sent to the Secretary at the e-mail address above, and should be received by 23:59 on Friday 1st November. Motions and supporting documentation will be circulated on Sunday 3rd November.</p>
<p>Members not able to attend the AGM will be able to propose and vote on motions remotely. Details will be given with the motions when circulated.</p>
